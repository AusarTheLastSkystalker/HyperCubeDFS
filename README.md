# Hyper Cube Shortest Path
11/05/23 Update

I decided to revist this code, which I wrote during the fall semester of my freshman year at Berkeley. Most of it is rewritten using concepts I learned in CS61B (hash maps, adjacency lists) and CS61C (binary). Whereas before I could only generate 10 dimensional hypercubes, I can now generate a 15 dimensional hypercube in 5 seconds. I can also find the shortest path (if it exists) in any subgraph of the hyper cube from any bitstring to another. 

Graph generation: O(n2^n)

Graph shortest_path: I'll think about this one another time...
